# Thinking Partner

A deterministic thinking partner that challenges assumptions and applies 150+ mental models to sharpen decisions, solve problems, and think more clearly.

Built on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot, and any AI agent that supports the standard.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add mattnowdev/thinking-partner
```

## What It Does

Not a lecture — a sparring session. Turns your AI agent into a thinking partner that:

- **Challenges assumptions** — Surfaces hidden beliefs you're treating as facts
- **Applies mental models** — Selects and deploys the right frameworks for your situation (150+ models across 17 disciplines)
- **Detects orientation capture** — Notices when your thinking serves comfort instead of truth
- **Maintains productive tension** — Holds complexity open long enough to find real insight
- **Keeps each turn focused** — Answers the exact question with minimum sufficient information, revealing depth only when needed

## When It Triggers

- "Help me think through X"
- "Challenge my thinking"
- "What am I missing?"
- "Play devil's advocate"
- "Stress test this idea"
- "Help me decide between X and Y"
- Any named mental model: SWOT, first principles, inversion, pre-mortem, 5 Whys, etc.

## What Makes It Different

| Feature | This Skill | Others |
|---|---|---|
| **Orientation Detection** | Diagnoses 6 thinking states (GT0-GT5) with targeted interventions | Generic questioning |
| **150+ Mental Models** | Full catalog organized by discipline with key questions | Handful of models |
| **Cognitive Operations** | 7 complementary operation pairs (Decouple/Re-couple, Hold/Resolve, etc.) | None |
| **Structured Workflow** | 6-step deterministic process from diagnosis to synthesis | Freeform |
| **Anti-Patterns** | Explicit guidance on what NOT to do | None |
